This repository is for my personal practice in Data Analytics and using GitHub, based on dataset found on kaggle.com. All resources obtained can be found inside the code (e.g. URL).
This is made public for the same purpose, thus if you're a fellow student in Data, feel free to look through and/or comments if any questions or feedback. Happy studying.
