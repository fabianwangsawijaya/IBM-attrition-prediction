The purpose of this project is for my personal practice in Data Analytics and using GitHub, based on dataset found on kaggle.com. All resources obtained can be found inside the code (e.g. URL).

The processes include 3 main steps:
1. Data Mining - grabbing dataset from kaggle.com and accessing the data via Python (pandas & opendatasets)
2. Data Processing / Exploration - analyze dataset using statistical methods via Python (matplotlib & seaborn)
3. Data Transformation & Modeling - make necessary changes in order to create statistical models and make predictions via Python (scikit-learn / sklearn)
No data visualization included yet other than some generic PDF files to see some plots.

We are dealing with categorical datasets and are not time series data, here are the involved Statistical Methods:
- Regression Tree
- Random Forest
- Log Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- KNN clustering

Model qualities are calculated by built-in functions in scikit-learn, as the following:
- Accuracy (accuracy_score)
- Precision (precision_score)
- Sensitivity / Recall (recall_score)
- F1 (f1_score)
- F2 (fbeta_score)

Note: Personal notes are added into my python files with the purpose of self-learning and/or self-reminder, you may find this redundant.
